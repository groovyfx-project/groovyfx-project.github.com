# GroovyFX Website Source

This repository contains the source for the [GroovyFX website](https://groovyfx.org) â€“ not all of it though,
for example the user manual source is held in the
[GroovyFX repository](https://github.com/groovyfx-project/groovyfx). Commits to this repository will show up
immediately on the website.
